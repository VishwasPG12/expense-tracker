# Expense Tracker

A simple, clean way to keep track of where your money is going. No complicated charts, no annoying notifications—just a straightforward tool to log your daily spends.

**"Cuz every rupee matters."**

## Why I built this
I wanted something that looked more like a clean Notion page or a modern mobile app. This project was also a good excuse to mess around with **Tailwind CSS v4** and see how the new engine handles minimalist UI.

## The Tech
* **React + Vite**: For a snappy frontend experience.
* **Tailwind v4**: Used for the "Modern Utility" look (clean borders, lots of white space).
* **Express & Node**: Simple API to handle the CRUD operations.
* **MongoDB**: To keep the transaction history persistent.

## The Look
I skipped the heavy shadows and bright colors. Instead, I used:
- **Rounded 3xl corners** for a friendly, mobile-app feel.
- **Zinc/Gray tones** to keep the focus on the numbers.
- **Subtle hover states** so it feels interactive without being distracting.

## How to run it
1. **Clone & Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd frontend
   npm install
